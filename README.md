# Overview
This repository contains both personal projects and some common Interview Coding Questions for C#.
Best Practice Coding Techniques have been used making the majority of the code self-explanatory for both beginners and experienced developers.

# Note
I have added in some of these projects a bunch of comments to highlight what I was doing. This in the real world is not a best practice. These comments are purely for educational purposes.
